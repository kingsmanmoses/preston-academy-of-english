            who have one-to-one lessons needs to give 24 hours notice of
            cancellation. Students will be charged for non-attendance of one to
            one classes if 24 hours notice is not given. Appropriate action will
            be taken when attendance is below 80% such as informing the sponsors
            of the student about their poor attendance. <br /> <br />
            All attendance letters, progress reports and final certificates are

            Preston Academy of English understands that long-term students may
            wish to take a short break from their course. Tuition fees will not
            be charged for authorized holidays agreed before the start of your
            course. However, if your teachers feel that you are missing a large
            amount of the course content, you may be asked to repeat your
            current level or be tested again on your return from holiday. <br />{" "}
            <br />
            If you wish to request a holiday after starting your course with
            PAE, please remember course fees during the holiday period will not
            be refunded, but the course end date may be extended by the period
            of the authorized holiday. Course end dates will not be extended in
            the case of an unauthorized absence. <br /> <br />
            Students must ask for time off from their course(s) by completing a
            Ã¢â‚¬ËœStudent Holiday Request Form, at least 2 weeks before the
            anticipated absence. This form is available from reception, and must
            be returned to the reception. <br /> <br />
            If your final attendance (after any requested holidays have been
            taken) is more than 80%, we will accept your request, and the time
            off will be marked as holiday. PAE will not accept your request if
            your attendance is less than 80%. Any days taken off without the
            knowledge or permission of PAE will be marked as absent. <br />{" "}
            <br />
            Do not book your flights or make holiday arrangements until you
            receive an email or letter from PAE confirming that your holiday has
            been approved. <br /> <br />
            To comply with PAE regulations, you are allowed a holiday period in
            accordance with your course duration. A maximum of 2 weeks may be
            taken at one time, and you must give 2 weeks notice when booking
            your holidays. <br /> <br />
            If you take an unauthorised holiday, this will be noted on your
            attendance record. Where students have been granted visas on the
            basis of their studies at PAE, the Home Office will be immediately
            notified of the unauthorized absence. <br /> <br />
            Students receiving course funding from the Saudi Arabian Cultural
            Bureau (SACB) must inform the SACB as well as PAE if they intend to
            travel outside the United Kingdom after commencing a course of
            study. PAE will notify the SACB of any unauthorized student absences
            or requests for course extensions, and the student will be directly
            responsible for any refunds demanded by the SACB. The SACB will also
            be informed if a student withdraws, or is suspended from a course.{" "}
